Hi,
<br>
<br>
We've launched an EMR cluster with access to telemetry published data, at your
request. As the cluster powers up you can:<br>
<ul>
  <li>monitor the cluster status,</li>
  <li>find the public DNS, and</li>
  <li>terminate the cluster,</li>
</ul>
here: {{ monitoring_url }}<br>
<br>
Please, be sure to kill your cluster when you're done with it.
